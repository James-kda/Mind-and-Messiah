              <p>
                Because sometimes love looks like staying through the storm, not
                escaping it

          <p>Love stays. Even when it hurts.</p>
          <p>
            There are moments when love doesn’t feel soft or sweet. It feels
            like a storm inside a house that refuses to collapse. Two people,
            angry, disappointed—maybe even hurt—standing in opposite corners of
            the same room. No one speaks. No one leaves. Not because they can’t,
            but because something sacred holds them there.
          </p>

          <p>
            We don’t often talk about this kind of love. The kind that stays
            when leaving would be easier. The kind that bleeds through conflict
            but refuses to run. It’s not romantic in the Hollywood sense—it’s
            raw, uncomfortable, and holy. It’s love with its sleeves rolled up
            and its heart still open, even when bruised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, the tension is unbearable. You look at the other person
            and feel fire in your chest—frustration, maybe betrayal. You want to
            scream, slam the door, walk away. But then something deeper stirs. A
            tether inside you pulls. And the ache you feel isn’t just anger.
            It’s the ache of longing—to be seen, understood, and restored. Not
            just to get your way, but to make it through together.
          </p>

          <p>
            That tension? That ache? That’s what love looks like when it chooses
            to stay.
          </p>

          <h3>Love that grieves is love that still hopes</h3>

          <p>
            Scripture calls us to bear with one another in love (Ephesians 4:2).
            It doesn’t say “bear with one another when it's easy.” It doesn’t
            tell us to avoid the fire—but to walk through it with humility,
            patience, and gentleness. When you’re in the thick of it—when the
            heat is rising and silence feels safer than honesty—you may wonder:
          </p>

          <p><strong>“Why are we even still here?”</strong></p>
          <p>
            The answer is simple and sacred: Because you both still care.
            Because even in pain, you still believe in the good that could be
            restored. Because underneath the tension is a deeper thread of grace
            that refuses to let go.
          </p>

          <p>This kind of love echoes God’s heart.</p>

          <p>
            He doesn’t abandon us when we lash out in pain or drift in
            stubbornness. He stays. He convicts. He calls. He draws us back not
            with shame, but with mercy. "I have loved you with an everlasting
            love," He says in Jeremiah 31:3. Everlasting—not just when you
            behave, not just when things feel good—but always.
          </p>

          <h3>How healing begins…</h3>

          <p>
            Healing doesn’t begin with fixing everything at once. It begins with
            one soft word in a hard moment. One act of humility when pride wants
            to win. One deep breath that chooses to stay open.
          </p>

          <p>
            It begins when one person reaches—not perfectly, but sincerely. “I’m
            still here.” “I don’t want to be against you—I want to find our way
            back.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The path to restoration is paved with little mercies. A listening
            ear. A hand extended. A prayer whispered through clenched teeth.
            When both people begin to see the other not as the enemy, but as
            worth fighting for, the tension doesn’t disappear—but it becomes the
            furnace where deeper love is forged.
          </p>

          <p>
            Christ doesn’t just call us to endure love. He empowers us to
            restore it. With His Spirit, we can choose the way of
            reconciliation, not just resistance. And in doing so, we reflect the
            One who stayed—on the cross, in the pain, for love.
          </p>

          <h3>So if you're in that place right now...</h3>

          <p>Tense. Tired. Tempted to walk away.</p>

          <p>
            Know this: You’re not stuck—you’re held. Not by guilt, not by
            weakness—but by a love that’s stronger than emotion. A love that
            says: “I’m not done. I still believe in this. I still believe in
            you.”
          </p>

          <p>That’s not weakness. <strong>That’s covenant.</strong></p>

          <p>
            And in a world that walks away too easily, maybe staying—honestly,
            humbly, even angrily—might be the most Christlike thing you can do.
